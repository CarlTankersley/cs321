1. Player 1 won all 25 games

2. Player 1 won no games, but did manage to draw one. Probably just happened to play decently by chance,
   which is not terribly unlikely with a branching factor of at most 5.

3. UCB constant = 0.5: 25/25 wins for Player 1
   UCB constant = 0.1: 23/25 wins for Player 1, with the remaining two games being draws 
   UCB constant = 0.3: 24/25 wins for Player 1, with the remaining game being a draw 
   UCB constant = 0.7: 24/25 wins for Player 1, with the remaining game being a draw 
   UCB constant = 0.9: 24/25 wins for Player 1, with the remaining game being a loss
   UCB constant = 1.5: 23/25 wins for Player 1, with the remaining two games being draws
   UCB constant = 0.0: 24/25 wins for Player 1, with the remaining game being a draw
   I expected somewhere around 0.5 to be best, since it just feels in some nebulous way 
   like a good balance between going with known effective options and also looking for
   greener pastures, but I'm honestly quite surprised how little of a difference varying
   the constant made. 

4. P1 - 64 rollouts, P2 - 8 rollouts. P1 won 22/25 and drew twice, with P2 winning once
   P1 - 512 rollouts, P2 - 8 rollouts. P1 won 23/25 and drew twice
   P1 - 512 rollouts, P2 - 64 rollouts. P1 won 9/25 and drew 13 times, with P2 winning 3
   P1 - 8 rollouts, P2 - 64 rollouts. P1 won 2/25 and drew three times, with P2 winning 20
   P1 - 8 rollouts, P2 - 512 rollouts. P1 won 0/25 and drew eight times, with P2 winning 17
   P1 - 64 rollouts, P2 - 512 rollouts. P1 won 4/25 and drew 12 times, with P2 winning 9
   P1 - 64 rollouts, P2 - 64 rollouts. P1 won 5/25 and drew 11, with P2 winning 8
   P1 - 512 rollouts, P2 - 512 rollouts. P1 won 3/25 and drew 18, with P2 winnning 4
   Unsurprisingly, more rollouts leads to a better win percentage, and when both players are
   smart, they draw more often. It would seem that as the players become more evenly matched,
   they will draw more and more often, which seems likely to asymptotically approach 100% of
   games played as the number of rollouts increases.
