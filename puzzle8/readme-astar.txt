For just depth-first search, the tests ran in about 200 seconds, on average, as compared to 394 seconds for iterative
deepening search. For A*, on the other hand, the tests ran in about 1.2 seconds, on average, with numWrongTiles as a
heuristic, and they ran in about 0.05 seconds using manhattanDistance. This tells us that A* is far faster than regular
iterative deepening (again, on average).
